# Usefull Patterns
- The Model View Controller Pattern is useful for webdev
    - Theres no problem in rewriting a large part of the html file, whenever something changes in the model, becuase DOM manipulations are very efficient
    - You don't neccessarily need strict seperation between Model and View. For example adding View as an observer to model seems pretty good
    - All references to dom objects are in the view
    - All functions that are called when the user interacts with the website are called in the Controller
- Observer
- Callback functions
